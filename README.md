# Inferring Prototypes for Multi-Label Few-Shot Image Classification with Word Vector Guided Attention (AAAI2022)
This is the data split for the AAAI2022 paper: Inferring Prototypes for Multi-Label Few-Shot Image Classification with Word Vector Guided Attention

This repository contains the support set jsons (100) for validaton and test splits of COCO and VOC datasets. To evaluate the model based on 200 sampled test episodes as mentioned in paper,
you need to sample two different random query sets for each support set. 

You don't need to worry about the randomness of the results, as you may find the final accuracy based on 200 test episodes changes little.
